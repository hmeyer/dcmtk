** CVS Log
** $Log: dimstore.cc,v $
** Revision 1.19  2005/12/08 15:44:46  meichel
** Changed include path schema for all DCMTK header files
**
** Revision 1.18  2005/02/22 09:40:58  meichel
** Fixed two bugs in "bit-preserving" Store SCP code. Errors while creating or
**   writing the DICOM file (e.g. file system full) now result in a DIMSE error
**   response (out of resources) being sent back to the SCU.
**
** Revision 1.17  2002/11/27 13:04:42  meichel
** Adapted module dcmnet to use of new header file ofstdinc.h
**
** Revision 1.16  2002/08/27 17:00:52  meichel
** Initial release of new DICOM I/O stream classes that add support for stream
**   compression (deflated little endian explicit VR transfer syntax)
**
** Revision 1.15  2001/11/01 13:49:04  wilkens
** Added lots of comments.
**
** Revision 1.14  2001/10/12 10:18:36  meichel
** Replaced the CONDITION types, constants and functions in the dcmnet module
**   by an OFCondition based implementation which eliminates the global condition
**   stack.  This is a major change, caveat emptor!
**
** Revision 1.13  2000/12/15 13:28:18  meichel
** Global flag to enable/disable workaround code for some buggy Store SCUs
**   in DIMSE_storeProvider().  If enabled, an illegal space-padding in the
**   Affected SOP Instance UID field of the C-STORE-RQ message is retained
**   in the corresponding C-STORE-RSP message.
**
** Revision 1.12  2000/11/10 18:07:45  meichel
** Mixed up strcmp and strcpy - oops.
**
** Revision 1.11  2000/11/10 16:25:03  meichel
** Fixed problem with DIMSE routines which attempted to delete /dev/null
**   under certain circumstances, which could lead to disastrous results if
**   tools were run with root permissions (what they shouldn't).
**
** Revision 1.10  2000/06/07 08:58:13  meichel
** added optional paramter to DIMSE_storeUser that enables precise file size
**   information inside the store user callback.
**
** Revision 1.9  2000/03/02 12:46:34  joergr
** Rewrote some memory related statements (memcpy, strcpy, etc.) to avoid
** warnings reported by BoundsChecker.
**
** Revision 1.8  2000/02/23 15:12:39  meichel
** Corrected macro for Borland C++ Builder 4 workaround.
**
** Revision 1.7  2000/02/03 11:50:12  meichel
** Moved UID related functions from dcmnet (diutil.h) to dcmdata (dcuid.h)
**   where they belong. Renamed access functions to dcmSOPClassUIDToModality
**   and dcmGuessModalityBytes.
**
** Revision 1.6  2000/02/01 10:24:11  meichel
** Avoiding to include <stdlib.h> as extern "C" on Borland C++ Builder 4,
**   workaround for bug in compiler header files.
**
** Revision 1.5  1999/04/19 08:36:31  meichel
** Added support for C-FIND-CANCEL/C-MOVE-CANCEL in DIMSE_storeUser().
**
** Revision 1.4  1998/08/10 08:53:46  meichel
** renamed member variable in DIMSE structures from "Status" to
**   "DimseStatus". This is required if dcmnet is used together with
**   <X11/Xlib.h> where Status is #define'd as int.
**
** Revision 1.3  1997/05/23 10:45:28  meichel
** Major rewrite of storescp application. See CHANGES for details.
** Changes required to interfaces of some DIMSE functions.
**
** Revision 1.2  1996/04/25 16:11:17  hewett
** Added parameter casts to char* for bzero calls.  Replaced some declarations
** of DIC_UL with unsigned long (reduces mismatch problems with 32 & 64 bit
** architectures).  Added some protection to inclusion of sys/socket.h (due
** to MIPS/Ultrix).
**
** Revision 1.1.1.1  1996/03/26 18:38:46  hewett
** Initial Release.
**
