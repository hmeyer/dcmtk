/* DUL_MakePresentationCtx
**
** Purpose:
**	Build a Presentation Context from the specified parameters
**
** Parameter Dictionary:
**	ctx		Pointer to the presentation context that is to
**			be built.
**	proposedSCRole	Proposed role played by the caller
**	acceptedSCRole	Accepted role (after negotiation)
**	ctxID		Unique ID for this presentation context
**	result
**	abstarctSyntax
**
** Return Values:
**	DUL_LISTERROR
**
**
** Notes:
**	The transfer syntax argument allows the caller to specify one
**	or more transfer syntaxes.  The function expects the caller to
**	terminate the set of transfer syntaxes with a NULL pointer.
**
**	Transfer syntaxes of 0 length are not considered an error and/but
**	are ignored.
**
** Algorithm:
**	Description of the algorithm (optional) and any other notes.

** CVS Log
** $Log: dulpres.cc,v $
** Revision 1.12  2005/12/08 15:44:53  meichel
** Changed include path schema for all DCMTK header files
**
** Revision 1.11  2002/11/27 13:04:46  meichel
** Adapted module dcmnet to use of new header file ofstdinc.h
**
** Revision 1.10  2002/11/26 15:37:02  meichel
** Changed DUL code to always send A-ASSOCIATE user information sub-items
**   in ascending order.
**
** Revision 1.9  2001/10/12 10:18:40  meichel
** Replaced the CONDITION types, constants and functions in the dcmnet module
**   by an OFCondition based implementation which eliminates the global condition
**   stack.  This is a major change, caveat emptor!
**
** Revision 1.8  2000/02/23 15:12:51  meichel
** Corrected macro for Borland C++ Builder 4 workaround.
**
** Revision 1.7  2000/02/01 10:24:14  meichel
** Avoiding to include <stdlib.h> as extern "C" on Borland C++ Builder 4,
**   workaround for bug in compiler header files.
**
** Revision 1.6  1999/03/29 11:20:08  meichel
** Cleaned up dcmnet code for char* to const char* assignments.
**
** Revision 1.5  1997/07/04 09:24:57  meichel
** Simplified some sizeof() constructs to avoid compiler warnings
**   on the IBM xlC compiler (AIX 3.x).
**
** Revision 1.4  1996/06/20 07:35:52  hewett
** Removed inclusion of system header already included by dcompat.h
** and made sure that dcompat.h is always included (via dicom.h).
**
** Revision 1.3  1996/05/03 10:31:56  hewett
** Move some common system include files out to include/dcompat.h which were
** causing problems due to multiple inclusion on some machines.
**
** Revision 1.2  1996/04/25 16:11:21  hewett
** Added parameter casts to char* for bzero calls.  Replaced some declarations
** of DIC_UL with unsigned long (reduces mismatch problems with 32 & 64 bit
** architectures).  Added some protection to inclusion of sys/socket.h (due
** to MIPS/Ultrix).
**
** Revision 1.1.1.1  1996/03/26 18:38:46  hewett
** Initial Release.
