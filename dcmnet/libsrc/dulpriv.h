** Module Name(s):
** Author, Date:	Stephen M. Moore, xx-May-92
** Intent:
**  This header contains private typedefs for the DICOM Upper Layer
**  (DUL) protocol package.  This is to be used to compile the DUL
**  package and is not intended to be seen by the applications programmer.
**  Files at the package level should include this file to get the
**  proper typedefs and include the public file "dulprotocol.h" to
**  get the public definitions and function prototypes.  I have omitted
**  the public definitions and prototypes on purpose so that they
**  exist in only one location.

/*
** CVS Log
** $Log: dulpriv.h,v $
** Revision 1.8  2005/12/08 15:48:09  meichel
** Updated Makefiles to correctly install header files
**
** Revision 1.7  2004/02/25 12:31:17  meichel
** Added global option flag for compatibility with very old DCMTK releases in the
**   DICOM upper layer and ACSE code. Default is automatic handling, which should
**   work in most cases.
**
** Revision 1.6  2001/10/12 10:18:41  meichel
** Replaced the CONDITION types, constants and functions in the dcmnet module
**   by an OFCondition based implementation which eliminates the global condition
**   stack.  This is a major change, caveat emptor!
**
** Revision 1.5  2001/09/26 12:29:04  meichel
** Implemented changes in dcmnet required by the adaptation of dcmdata
**   to class OFCondition.  Removed some unused code.
**
** Revision 1.4  2000/03/03 14:11:26  meichel
** Implemented library support for redirecting error messages into memory
**   instead of printing them to stdout/stderr for GUI applications.
**
** Revision 1.3  1997/07/21 08:47:25  andreas
** - Replace all boolean types (BOOLEAN, CTNBOOLEAN, DICOM_BOOL, BOOL)
**   with one unique boolean type OFBool.
**
** Revision 1.2  1997/01/13 15:53:13  hewett
** Added missing function prototypes (required for CodeWarrior 10).
**
** Revision 1.1.1.1  1996/03/26 18:38:46  hewett
** Initial Release.
