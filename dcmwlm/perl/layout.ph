#   Revision 1.1  2002/12/03 12:16:05  wilkens
#   Added files und functionality from the dcmtk/wlisctn folder to dcmtk/dcmwlm
#   so that dcmwlm can now completely replace wlistctn in the public domain part
#   of dcmtk. Pertaining to this replacement requirement, another optional return
#   key attribute was integrated into the wlm utilities.
