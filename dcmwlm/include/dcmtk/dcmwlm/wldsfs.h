/*
** CVS Log
** $Log: wldsfs.h,v $
** Revision 1.15  2005/12/08 16:05:41  meichel
** Changed include path schema for all DCMTK header files
**
** Revision 1.14  2005/05/04 11:33:17  wilkens
** Modified handling of the attributes ScheduledProcedureStepDescription/
** ScheduledProtocolCodeSequence and RequestedProcedureDescription/
** RequestedProcedureCodeSequence in wlmscpfs: in case one of the two attributes
** does not contain any information in a C-Find RSP message which is about to be
** sent to an SCU, the empty attribute will be removed from the C-Find RSP message
** before the message is sent, in order not to send an invalid RSP message.
** Added two command line options --enable-file-reject (default) and
** --disable-file-reject to wlmscpfs: these options can be used to enable or
** disable a file rejection mechanism which makes sure only complete worklist files
** will be used during the matching process. A worklist file is considered to be
** complete if it contains all necessary type 1 information which the SCP might
** have to return to an SCU in a C-Find response message.
**
** Revision 1.13  2004/05/26 10:36:53  meichel
** Fixed minor bug in worklist server regarding failed read locks.
**
** Revision 1.12  2004/01/07 08:32:28  wilkens
** Added new sequence type return key attributes to wlmscpfs. Fixed bug that for
** equally named attributes in sequences always the same value will be returned.
** Added functionality that also more than one item will be returned in sequence
** type return key attributes.
**
** Revision 1.11  2003/08/21 13:38:55  wilkens
** Moved declaration and initialization of member variables matchingDatasets and
** NumOfMatchingDatasets to base class.
**
** Revision 1.10  2003/07/02 09:17:55  wilkens
** Updated documentation to get rid of doxygen warnings.
**
** Revision 1.9  2002/12/16 11:08:34  wilkens
** Added missing #include "osconfig.h" to certain files.
**
** Revision 1.8  2002/12/09 13:40:49  joergr
** Renamed parameter to avoid name clash with global function index().
**
** Revision 1.7  2002/08/12 10:56:08  wilkens
** Made some modifications in in order to be able to create a new application
** which contains both wlmscpdb and ppsscpdb and another application which
** contains both wlmscpfs and ppsscpfs.
**
** Revision 1.6  2002/08/05 09:09:57  wilkens
** Modfified the project's structure in order to be able to create a new
** application which contains both wlmscpdb and ppsscpdb.
**
** Revision 1.4  2002/07/17 13:10:17  wilkens
** Corrected some minor logical errors in the wlmscpdb sources and completely
** updated the wlmscpfs so that it does not use the original wlistctn sources
** any more but standard wlm sources which are now used by all three variants
** of wlmscps.
**
** Revision 1.3  2002/06/10 11:24:54  wilkens
** Made some corrections to keep gcc 2.95.3 quiet.
**
** Revision 1.2  2002/04/18 14:19:53  wilkens
** Modified Makefiles. Updated latest changes again. These are the latest
** sources. Added configure file.
**
** Revision 1.3  2002/01/08 17:45:34  joergr
** Reformatted source files (replaced Windows newlines by Unix ones, replaced
** tabulator characters by spaces, etc.)
**
** Revision 1.2  2002/01/08 16:47:53  joergr
** Added preliminary database support using OTL interface library (modified by
** MC/JR on 2001-12-21).
**
** Revision 1.1  2002/01/08 16:30:59  joergr
** Added new module "dcmwlm" developed by Thomas Wilkens (initial release for
** Windows, dated 2001-12-20).
