** CVS Log
** $Log: wltypdef.h,v $
** Revision 1.11  2005/12/08 16:05:44  meichel
** Changed include path schema for all DCMTK header files
**
** Revision 1.10  2005/09/23 12:56:40  wilkens
** Added attribute PatientsBirthDate as a matching key attribute to wlmscpfs.
** Thanks to Andre M. Descombes <andre@descombes.info> for the code template.
**
** Revision 1.9  2004/01/07 08:32:28  wilkens
** Added new sequence type return key attributes to wlmscpfs. Fixed bug that for
** equally named attributes in sequences always the same value will be returned.
** Added functionality that also more than one item will be returned in sequence
** type return key attributes.
**
** Revision 1.8  2003/12/23 13:04:36  wilkens
** Integrated new matching key attributes into wlmscpfs.
**
** Revision 1.7  2003/07/02 09:17:55  wilkens
** Updated documentation to get rid of doxygen warnings.
**
** Revision 1.6  2002/12/16 11:08:36  wilkens

** Revision 1.5  2002/08/12 10:56:09  wilkens
** Made some modifications in in order to be able to create a new application
** which contains both wlmscpdb and ppsscpdb and another application which
** contains both wlmscpfs and ppsscpfs.
**
** Revision 1.4  2002/07/17 13:10:37  wilkens
** Corrected some minor logical errors in the wlmscpdb sources and completely
** updated the wlmscpfs so that it does not use the original wlistctn sources
** any more but standard wlm sources which are now used by all three variants
** of wlmscps.
**
** Revision 1.3  2002/04/18 14:20:09  wilkens
